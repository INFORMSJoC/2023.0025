1. In the folder Impact of delay-tolerance, the file Solutions XX with tolerance(A-B).xlsx includes the optimal appointment schedules and sequence solutions as shown in Table 2 for model XX under delay-tolerance threshold (A-B), where XX could be ED, TAD and DUM, and (A,B) could take the values (1,0.5) (1,1) (1,1.5) and (1,2). Moreover, the file Summary.xlsx contains the out-of-sample performance comparisons for the three models that have been presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Finally, the file time tolerance(A-B).txt inside folder Simulation(C,D) records the computational time for these models under delay-tolerance threshold (A-B) and with number of users (C,D), where (A,B) could take the values (1,1) (1,1.5) and (1.5,1), and (C,D) could take the values (3,7) (5,5) and (7,3).
   
2. In the folder Impact of user heterogeneity, the file Summary.xlsx contains the out-of-sample performance comparisons for the three models under different number of user types that have been presented in Table 6. In addition, the file time_A.txt inside the folder K-B records the computational times for ED, TAD and DUM models, where A represents the number of user types and takes the values 2, 3, 4 and 5, and B represents the sample size and takes the values 100, 500 and 1000.
   
3. In the folder Impact of service-time distribution ambiguity, the file Summary_TAD.xlsx contains the out-of-sample performance comparisons under different delay-tolerance thresholds that have been presented in Table 8.
   
4. In the folder A case using real patient data, the files Summary-A.xlsx and Summary-B.xlsx contain the out-of-sample performance comparisons for the three models in the case study, where the patients are categorized as FV and RV in Section 6.4.1, and with consulting time in Section 6.4.2, respectively. Moreover, the figure Waiting_time.png illustrates the distributions of the waiting times (minutes) and consulting times (minutes) of the outpatient data. The figure DOT.png shows the out-of-sample delay over tolerance for patients. 
   
5. In the folder Additional numerical experiments, the file Solutions TAD with tolerance(1-1)-X.xlsx includes the optimal appointment schedules and sequence solutions under idle time tolerance threshold X, where X could take the values 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5, which have been summarized in Table EC.1. Moreover, the file Summary(A-B).xlsx contains the out-of-sample performance comparisons for the three models under different idle time tolerances, where (A,B) represents the number of users and takes the values (3,7) (5,5) and (7,3). In addition, the file time tolerance(1-1) inside folder Simulation(A,B) of folder Computational time records the computational times for these models under different numbers of users (A,B). Finally, the file Summary samples-A-B.xlsx includes the relative out-of-sample performance with different training sample sizes.

Note that "P", "E", "S", "W" recorded in file Summary.xlsx represent the respective out-of-sample comparison criteria (P_A/P_B - 1), (E_A/E_B - 1), (S_A/S_B - 1), (W_A/W_B - 1) between model A and B, for instance, the ED model vs the TAD model in Table 3.
