# Data for replication

Here is the data needed for replicating the experiments. 

1. The file Simulation Samples.xlsx contains 3000 randomly generated service time samples from the generating distribution as stated in Section 6.1.

2. The file Statistics without outlier.xlsx includes the real case samples and statistics used in our case study.

3. The file Service Time Matrix Based on Visit Type1.xlsx contains 2000 randomly selected service time samples from the real case samples via categorizing patients as FV and RV.

4. The file Service Time Matrix Samples.xlsx contains 2000 randomly selected service time samples from the real case samples by categorizing patients with consulting time.

5. The files Simulation samples-1000-10-X.xlsx contains the generated service time samples that are used in Section 6.2, where X represents the number of user types and could take the values 2, 3, 4 and 5.
